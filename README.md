# ABQ Where's The Bus

An Android app showing real time information about ABQ Ride buses. Created with data from the Albuquerque open data initiative.

When the user selects a stop nearby the app shows the scheduled times for buses to arrive at that stop. If real time information is available about the bus that is scheduled to arrive at that time, the app will also predict whether that bus will be on time or how late it will be. The user can then click on the scheduled time to see a real-time location for that bus.
